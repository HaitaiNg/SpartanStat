-- Pseudo Code Algorithm

-- initialize pins (output pins, write pins)
-- receive user input ( pulse or linear sweep, step size) //We might temporarily hard code the step size to be a set size
-- generate and execute the respective algorithm

-- output to the DAC

// This section still needs to be completed
-- configure pins as inputs
-- read values and parse them to their respective output pins
-- output to the labView / graphing software
